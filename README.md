The shutdown process is only activated if no users are streaming media. This is determined by analyzing web XML info of the server status. If no users are found a predefined number of times consecutively the script initiates the shutdown process. Time between checks are user defined. Benefits of using this script include personal savings, respect from environmentalists and convenience from the automation.
